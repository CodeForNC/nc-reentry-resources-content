<p>Connecting with a healthcare professional as soon as possible after release from incarceration is an important step. Restoration of Medicaid and Medicare benefits does not occur automatically.</p>

<p>If you are not eligible for Medicaid or Medicare, you can obtain health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).</p>

<p>Release from detention constitutes a qualifying life event under the ACA and entitles the person to apply for health coverage on the Marketplace. <strong>Applicants must apply within 60 days of release.</strong> Medicaid, Medicare, and the ACA can be applied for all at the same time.</p>
