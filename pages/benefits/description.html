<p>Having a criminal conviction will not necessarily prevent someone from receiving benefits such as Food Stamps, Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security or Social Security Disability income. </p>

<p>A good place to start is the Federal Interagency Reentry Council’s <a href="https://www.usich.gov/resources/uploads/asset_library/REENTRY_MYTHBUSTERS.pdf" target=“_blank”> Reentry MythBusters website</a>. It dispels common myths about what federal benefits a person may qualify for, even if convicted of a felony. Another good resource is the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/reentry/" target="_blank">Social Security Administration</a>, which provides information on qualifying and applying for benefits.</p>
