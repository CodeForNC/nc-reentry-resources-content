<p>It is a common misconception that those who have been incarcerated or have a felony conviction do not qualify for Federal Student Aid. In fact, changes to federal laws have opened up opportunities for those with a criminal history to further their education. Gaining post-secondary education for those returning to the community after incarceration can increase the chances of employment and independence.</p>

<p>If you are on probation, parole, or living in a halfway house, you may be eligible for federal student aid, including <a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Pell Grants</a>.

The <a href="https://www.usich.gov/resources/uploads/asset_library/REENTRY_MYTHBUSTERS.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Federal Student Aid page</a> debunks myths associated with qualifying for post-secondary college funding.</p>
