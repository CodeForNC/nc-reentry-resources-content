Having a place to live that is affordable and that is accessible to stores, job opportunities,
public transportation and other public services is one of the most important needs for those
reentering the community after a period of incarceration, and it can be a daunting task.
</p>

<p>Here are some important things to know:
<ul>
<li>Spend no more than 30% to 40% of your income on rent.</li>
<li>Your specific criminal history can impact the type of housing that is available to you.</li>
<li>Affordable housing can be limited and go very quickly. Follow up immediately when you hear about opportunities before it’s too late.</li>
<li>It’s important to make a good impression when you meet or talk with perspective landlords or roommates. Show up on time, dress neatly, and be polite. First impressions really matter so present your best self.</li> 
<li>You have the right to request your free credit report each year through the <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0155-free-credit-reports" target="_blank">FTC website</a>.</li>
<li>If you are a Veteran you may qualify for Veterans assistance.</li>
<li>Women may qualify for special housing, such as women-only or women with children options.</li>
<li>People with certain disabilities may qualify for special assistance or assisted-living housing options.</li>
