# NC Reentry Resources Content 

The original [Buncombe County Reentry Resources Hub](http://www.buncombereentryhub.org/) is implemented as a Wordpress website, and individual topic pages were written by a variety of people, so that they don't follow a single standard template.

In this implementation, content for a topic page for a given county has a strict form:

1. __Common Description__: a block of HTML text with information relevant statewide (or nationally)
2. __Local Description__: a block of HTML text with information relevant to the specific county
3. __National & State Resources__: a list of resources common to all counties
4. __Local Resources__: a list of resources relevant to the specific county
5. __211 Resources__: a list of resources pulled from the 211 database based on categories

where all resources consist of:

- Name
- Short description
- URL
- Category

For counties that do not have tailored content, the topic page will be created only from 1, 3, and 5.
